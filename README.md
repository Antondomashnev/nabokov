## Current status
This project is on the early development stage and is *not ready for production*. The `master` branch is empty and now the current status can be checked in `develop` branch. Also readme is not ready at all and we'll be updated as soon as the first functional becomes to the `master` branch.

## Behind the scene
This is my first ruby project except small experiments on the local machine before. So please bare it in mind and I would really appreciate any point about code style or even better way to implement something

## License
This project is open source under the MIT license, which means you have full access to the source code and can modify it to fit your own needs.
